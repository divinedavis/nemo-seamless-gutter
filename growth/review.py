"""The daily review: keep what works, retire what doesn't, drop what's redundant.

This is the half of the loop that makes it self-improving rather than merely
automated. Every day it re-reads the measured series behind each active
technique and asks three questions:

  1. Has it had a fair run?      (below GRACE_DAYS, nothing is judged — SEO
                                  changes take weeks to show up in a series)
  2. Did it earn its traffic?    (owned visitors since activation vs threshold)
  3. Is it redundant?            (another technique owns overlapping URLs and
                                  massively outperforms it)

Retiring is cheap and reversible: status flips to "retired", the driver stops
running it tomorrow, and the verdict stays in the ledger forever so the same
idea does not get re-proposed as if it were new.
